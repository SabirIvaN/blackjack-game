# Blackjack Game

This project was created to learn Python. It implements one of the most popular casino games - Blackjack.

The basis for this project was the project of [Solomeo Leo](https://github.com/solomonleo12345). You can follow the [link](https://github.com/solomonleo12345/BLACKJACK-Game/tree/main) to it.

## Features

In this project, the application architecture was improved by dividing the application into modules, additional comments were added to methods and class methods that improve code understanding, and a Makefile was added to run the app.py file as executable in the console.

## Starting

The following Makefile commands are used to run the project:
- `make build` to make the app.py file executable
- `make start` to make the app.py file executable and run it
- `make run` to simply run the app.py executable
